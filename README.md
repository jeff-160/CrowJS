CrowJS is a JavaScript superset that incorporates C++ style macros, seeking to provide convenience when programming by reducing repetitive code.


## Getting started

Set up CrowJS by running the `build.bat` file
```batch
> build.bat
```

Write your code
```javascript
// myfile.js
#define MACRO console.log(__DATE__)

MACRO;
```

Transpile to JavaScript
```batch
> crow myfile.js
Transpiled to test.js
Process exited after 0.055058 seconds
```
